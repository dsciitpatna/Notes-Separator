**How-To
If you are a contributer of this project, fork this repo and make a directory in the "Models" directory by your name and dump your code and utils in that directory alongwith  a readme file which presents the model, your accuracy and other confusion matrix paramaters. After that you can push your code and we will merge it if the project serves the objective.
